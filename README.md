# GOV52_final_project
This is the repository for my final project for GOV-52, in which I use multilevel regression and post-stratification to predict subnational levels of public opinion, focusing on those who believe Biden was not the legitimate winner of the 2020 Presidential Election to determine which electoral districts most lack electoral legitimacy ahead of the 2022 Midterm Elections.

Final shapefiles for the congressional and state senate (upper house) level can be found here: https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/BrendanTHartnett_gov52 (due to size, they cannot be hosted on GitHub).
